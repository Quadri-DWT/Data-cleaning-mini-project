Data cleaning
Report:					
Below are the step taken in the cleaning of the dataset and insight from the cleaning data					
Firstly: I convert the data to a table so as to maintain a close relationship between them					
Secondly: I cleaned the data by removed ID duplicates by the the use of remove duplicate function in excel under data tool and I also removed the entire row where we have non value or character on the price per unit column
